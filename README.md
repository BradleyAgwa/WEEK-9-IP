# TITANIC SURVIVOR PREDICTION & SPAM EMAIL FILTER
###### By Bradley Agwa

## Description
### K Nearest Neighbors
This project makes use of the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts which of the passengers were most likely to survive the Titanic shipwreck. The model is built using K-Nearest Neighbors classifier where different techniques such as finding the optimal number of K and changing the distance metrics have been employed to improve the performance of the model.

### Naive Bayes Classifier
Using the Spambase dataset, this uses  Naive Bayes Classifier to predict which messages are spam and which messages are not spam based . The Support Vector Machines has also been used to compare which of the models performed best on this dataset.
